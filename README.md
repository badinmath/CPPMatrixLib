*CPPMatrixLib*

This is my Seasons of Code Project done under WnCC, IIT Bombay with mentor Laxman Desai and group members Sanskar Narlawar,Kadoo Aditya Anil, Parth Dwivedi, Ashish Patel. 

We were given source code at the beginning of the project by our mentor.

Project Aim-
Create a math library similar to numPy in C++ CPPMatrixLib.

What Ive done so Far-

March and april beginning- Learned basic DSA concepts and linear algebra. Built a gauss elimination function for inverse of matrix. Solved CP problems given by mentor on various platforms such as codeforces, SPOJ,etc.

April beginning to may- Learned Gitflow through practice and did many CP problems on various platforms. Watched videos on linear algebra and dynamic programming.

June-Learned and applied unit testing to the matrix library(using CMake and Gtest). Helped implement primes library with a peer.

July- Created a working directory for the project and learned some number theory. Resolved merge conflicts and integrated code.
