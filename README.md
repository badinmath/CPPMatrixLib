We were given source code at the beginning of the project by our mentor.

Our main aim in this project was to create an open source Matrix Library in C++, with functionality similar to the Numpy and MATLAB libraries. In addition to this, we also aimed to create a polynomial and modint library with related functions.

What Ive done so Far-

March and april beginning- Learned basic DSA concepts and linear algebra. Built a gauss elimination function for inverse of matrix. Solved CP problems given by mentor on various platforms such as codeforces, SPOJ,etc.

April beginning to may- Learned Gitflow through practice and did many CP problems on various platforms. Watched videos on linear algebra and dynamic programming.

June-Learned and applied unit testing to the matrix library(using CMake and Gtest). Helped implement primes library with a peer.

July- Created a working directory for the project and learned some number theory. Resolved merge conflicts and integrated code.
