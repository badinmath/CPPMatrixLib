March and april beginning- Learned basic DSA concepts and linear algebra. Built a gauss elimination function for inverse of matrix. Solved CP problems given by mentor on various platforms such as codeforces, SPOJ,etc.

April beginning to may- Learned Gitflow through practice and did many CP problems on various platforms. Watched videos on linear algebra and dynamic programming.

June-Learned and applied unit testing to the matrix library(use CMake and Gtest). Helped implement modint library with a peer.

July- Created a working directory for the project and learned some number theory. Resolved merge conflicts and integrated code.
